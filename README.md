# Unmaintained

Flask-OAuth is currently unmaintained. If you want to add OAuth support to
your Flask website, we recommend using
[Flask-Dance](https://github.com/singingwolfboy/flask-dance) instead,
which is actively maintained.

## Flask-OAuth

Implements basic OAuth support for Flask.  It can only
be used to hook up with external OAuth services.  It does not
support implementing providers.
