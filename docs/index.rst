Flask-OAuth
===========

.. module:: flask_oauth

Flask-OAuth is an extension to `Flask`_ that allows you to interact with
remote `OAuth`_ enabled applications.  Currently it only implements the
consumer interface so you cannot expose your own API with OAuth.  It
depends on the `python-oauth2`_ module.  You can install the requirements
from PyPI with `easy_install` or `pip` or download them by hand.

Features
--------

- support for OAuth 1.0a
- friendly API
- direct integration with Flask
- basic support for remote method invocation of RESTful APIs

Installation
------------

Install the extension with one of the following commands::

    $ easy_install Flask-OAuth

or alternatively if you have `pip` installed::

    $ pip install Flask-OAuth

.. _Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/
.. _OAuth: http://oauth.net/
.. _python-oauth2: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/oauth2/

Defining Remote Applications
----------------------------

To use connect to a remote application you need to create a :class:`OAuth`
object and register a remote application on it.  This can be done with
the :meth:`~OAuth.remote_app` method::

    oauth = OAuth()
    the_remote_app = oauth.remote_app('the remote app',
        ...
    )

A remote application has to defined with a couple of URLs required for the
OAuth machinery: the `request_token_url`, `access_token_url`, and
`authorize_url`.  You will most likely get these values after you
registered your own application on the developer page of the remote
application you want to connect with.  Additionally a per-application
issued `consumer_key` and `consumer_secret` is needed.

Additionally you can provide a `base_url` that is prefixed to *all*
relative URLs used in the remote app.  This would also affect the
`request_token_url` but because The prefix for `oauth` and the regular
twitter API are different one has to provide absolute URLs for the OAuth
token and authenticate methods.

For Twitter the setup would look like this::

    twitter = oauth.remote_app('twitter',
        base_url='http://api.twitter.com/1/',
        request_token_url='http://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token',
        access_token_url='http://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token',
        authorize_url='http://api.twitter.com/oauth/authenticate',
        consumer_key='<your key here>',
        consumer_secret='<your secret here>'
    )

Twitter supports two authorization urls: ``/authenticate`` and
``/authorize``.  The difference is the user interface shown to the user on
twitter.  ``/authenticate`` should be used if the intent of OAuth is to
use the twitter identity of the user to sign in to your own website, the
``/authorize`` endpoint should be used to just access the twitter API and
not using the user profile on your own website.

Now that the application is created one can start using the OAuth system.
One thing is missing: the tokengetter. OAuth uses a token and a secret to
basically figure out who is connecting to the remote application.  After
authentication/authorization this information is passed to a function on
your side and it's your responsibility to remember it.

The following rules apply:

-   it's your responsibility to store that information somewhere
-   that information lives for as long as the user did not revoke the
    access for your application on the remote application.  If it was
    revoked and the user re-enabled the application you will get different
    keys, so if you store them in the database don't forget to check if
    they changed in the authorization callback.
-   During the authorization handshake a temporary token and secret are
    issued, your tokengetter is not used during that period.

For a simple test application, storing that information in the session is
probably good enough::

    from flask import session

    @twitter.tokengetter
    def get_twitter_token():
        return session.get('twitter_token')

Note that the function must return `None` if the token does not exist, and
otherwise return a tuple in the form ``(token, secret)``.

Signing in / Authorizing
------------------------

If you want to sign in with Twitter or link a user account with a remote
twitter user, all you have to do is to call into
:meth:`~OAuthRemoteApp.authorize` and pass it the URL to where the user
should be redirected back.  Here an example::

    @app.route('/login')
    def login():
        return twitter.authorize(callback=url_for('oauth_authorized',
            next=request.args.get('next') or request.referrer or None))

If the application redirects back, Twitter will have passed all the relevant
information to the `oauth_authorized` function.  It is passed a special
response object with all the data, or ``None`` if the user denied the
request.  This function has to be decorated as
:meth:`~OAuthRemoteApp.authorized_handler`::

    from flask import redirect

    @app.route('/oauth-authorized')
    @twitter.authorized_handler
    def oauth_authorized(resp):
        next_url = request.args.get('next') or url_for('index')
        if resp is None:
            flash(u'You denied the request to sign in.')
            return redirect(next_url)

        session['twitter_token'] = (
            resp['oauth_token'],
            resp['oauth_token_secret']
        )
        session['twitter_user'] = resp['screen_name']

        flash('You were signed in as %s' % resp['screen_name'])
        return redirect(next_url)

As you can see here: we store the token and the associated secret in the
session so that the tokengetter can return it.  Additionally we also
remember the Twitter screen name that was sent back to us so that we can
display that information to the user.  In larger applications it is
recommended to store that information in the database instead because it
allows you to easier debug things and you can store additional information
associated with the user.

Facebook OAuth
--------------

For facebook the flow is very similar to twitter or other OAuth systems
but there is a small difference.  You're not using the `request_token_url`
at all and you need to provide a scope in te `request_token_params`::

    facebook = oauth.remote_app('facebook',
        base_url='https://graph.facebook.com/',
        request_token_url=None,
        access_token_url='/oauth/access_token',
        authorize_url='https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth',
        consumer_key=FACEBOOK_APP_ID,
        consumer_secret=FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET,
        request_token_params={'scope': 'email'}
    )

Furthermore the `callback` is mandatory for the call to
:meth:`~OAuthRemoteApp.authorize` and has to match the base URL that was
specified in the facebook application control panel.  For development you
can set it to ``localhost:5000``.

The `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET` can be retrieved from the facebook app
control panel.  If you don't have an application registered yet you can do
this at `facebook.com/developers <https://www.facebook.com/developers/createapp.php>`_.

Invoking Remote Methods
-----------------------

Now the user is signed in, that is nice, but most likely you want to use
OAuth to call protected remote API methods and not just sign in.  For
that, the remote application object provides a
:meth:`~OAuthRemoteApp.request` method that can request information from
an OAuth protected resource.  Additionally there are shortcuts like
:meth:`~OAuthRemoteApp.get` or :meth:`~OAuthRemoteApp.post` to request
data with a certain HTTP method.

For example to create a new tweet you would call into the twitter
application like this::

    resp = twitter.post('statuses/update.json', data={
        'status':   'The text we want to tweet'
    })
    if resp.status == 403:
        flash('Your tweet was too long.')
    else:
        flash('Successfully tweeted your tweet (ID: #%s)' % resp.data['id'])

Or to display the users's home timeline we can do something like this::

    resp = twitter.get('statuses/home_timeline.json')
    if resp.status == 200:
        tweets = resp.data
    else:
        tweets = None
        flash('Unable to load tweets from Twitter. Maybe out of '
              'API calls or Twitter is overloaded.')

Flask-OAuth will do its best to sent data encoded in the right format to
the server and to decode it when it comes back.  Incoming data is encoded
based on the `mimetype` the server sent and stored in the
:attr:`~OAuthResponse.data` attribute.  For outgoing data a default of
``'urlencode'`` is assumed and when a different format is wanted, one can
specify it with the `format` parameter.  The following formats are
supported:

**Outgoing**:
    ``'urlencode'`` - form encoded data (`GET` as URL and `POST`/`PUT` as
    request body)
    ``'json'`` - JSON encoded data (`POST`/`PUT` as request body)

**Incoming**
    ``'urlencode'`` - stored as flat unicode dictionary
    ``'json'`` - decoded with JSON rules, most likely a dictionary
    ``'xml'`` - stored as elementtree element

Unknown incoming data is stored as string.  If outgoing data of a different
format should be used, a `content_type` can be specified instead and the
data provided a encoded string.
